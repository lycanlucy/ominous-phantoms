Ominous Phantoms is a Minecraft mod for NeoForge that alters the way Phantoms spawn. Instead of appearing after three days of no sleep, they spawn after a players tries to sleep while under the Bad Omen effect; this changes the effect into a new one called Night Omen, which draws in Phantoms to that player.

The mod comes with other configurable features, more info can be found in the Modrinth or CurseForge pages.
